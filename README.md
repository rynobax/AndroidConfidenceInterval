# Android Confidence Interval Activity

This is the activity files for the portion of a Statistics Application I developed with a group at Clemson University.

The activity generates samples based on user input, then calculates and displays confidence intervals based on the user input, which is displayed on a chart.

## Technical Details
ProportionSample and MeanSample are classes that contains information about a generated sample.  The implementations for generating the samples as well as calculating the confidence intervals from the samples is contained in them.
The chart of confidence intervals is generated using a Canvas and ShapeDrawables in a custom View, named ConfidenceIntervalChartView.  A variety of settings, including coloring, margins, and line thickness, can be modified in itâ€™s constructor.
The other charts are generated using aFreeChart, and the code for them is in the main ConfidenceIntervalActivity class.
